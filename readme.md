Hello :)

This is some kind of Snake game :)

I added direction buttons for mobile phones, so it can be played on those devices too.

Also, when device is landscape, direction buttons are on the left and right side of phone, so they are reachable.

I'm still learning JavaScript, this mini-project I found on Kenny Yip Coding YouTube channel,
and it was interesting to me, so I did it

Also, I done it with SASS, it is fun way to do CSS

Any advice is wellcome :)
